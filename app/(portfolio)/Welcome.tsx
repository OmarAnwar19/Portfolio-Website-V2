        I'm a passionate developer and student, with particular expertise in
        full stack development and data science. My technical skills include
        experience with various full-stack frameworks, data science packages,
        and more. I am always eager to learn and expand my knowledge base, and
        am always open to exploring new technologies and tools that can enhance
        my work! I also have a keen interest in the business side of tech, and
        have been part of multiple startups in the past!

        When I'm not working, you can find me exploring new hiking trails,
        trying out new recipes in the kitchen, or playing board games with
        friends and family. Welcome to my portfolio!
